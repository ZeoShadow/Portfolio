## Introduction

Hey, I'm Chang Yang, a current senior at Eden Prairie High School, aspiring to be a software engineer with a vision to create solutions for everyday problems. I've always had a passion for technology and dove deeper into that field in middle school. From developing games to coding apps to creating websites, there's a limitless potential for creativity. There's nothing as satisfactory as encountering issues along the way and then being able to solve that issue. Then, there's optimizing code for efficiency and reworking other parts to incorporate new ideas. Starting out, seeing error messages along the way was like the end of the world for me. Now, I see it as a norm as coding perfectly on the first try is more of an issue. I plan to explore and become more proficient in more languages to maximize my potential.
